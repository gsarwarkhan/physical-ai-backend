# Personalizing Your Learning Journey

This textbook is designed to be a dynamic resource that adapts to your specific needs and hardware background. To achieve this, we leverage a user profile system and content toggles to present the most relevant information for your learning environment.

## Identifying Your Hardware with Better-Auth

At the beginning of your journey with this textbook, you'll be prompted to sign in using our **Better-Auth** system. A key part of your user profile is the **"Primary Lab Environment"** setting.

When you set up your profile, you can specify the hardware you'll be using:
-   **Digital Twin Workstation:** For users who have a powerful local machine with an NVIDIA RTX GPU.
-   **Cloud-Native Lab:** For users who will be renting GPU instances from a cloud provider like AWS or GCP.
-   **Edge AI Kit:** For users who are primarily focused on deploying to and developing for a physical NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano.

Our system securely stores this preference. The textbook's front-end can then query this setting to dynamically adjust the content you see, ensuring the instructions match your setup.

## The 'Personalize Content' Logic

Throughout the textbook, you will encounter sections—especially those involving setup or deployment—that have a "Personalize Content" toggle or automatically display content relevant to you. This is achieved through a straightforward logic system.

### How It Works

Here is a simplified JavaScript-based example of the logic that runs on a page to show you the correct hardware-specific instructions:

```javascript
// This is a simplified example of the logic running on the page.

function personalizePageContent() {
  // 1. Get the user's hardware profile from the authentication system.
  //    (In a real implementation, this would be a secure API call).
  const userHardwareProfile = "Cloud-Native Lab"; // Example value

  // 2. Hide all personalized blocks by default.
  const allPersonalizedBlocks = document.querySelectorAll('.personalized-block');
  allPersonalizedBlocks.forEach(block => {
    block.style.display = 'none';
  });

  // 3. Find the specific block that matches the user's profile and display it.
  const targetBlockClass = `.content-for-${userHardwareProfile.toLowerCase().replace(/\s+/g, '-')}`;
  const targetBlock = document.querySelector(targetBlockClass);
  
  if (targetBlock) {
    targetBlock.style.display = 'block';
  } else {
    // If no specific block is found, show the default instructions.
    document.querySelector('.content-for-default').style.display = 'block';
  }
}
```

### Example in Markdown

In practice, a chapter that discusses deploying a ROS 2 node would be written like this in markdown, with different instructions nested inside styled `div` elements:

#### Deployment Example

<div className="personalized-block content-for-default" style={{display: 'none'}}>

**Default Deployment Instructions:**
1.  Ensure your target device is connected to the network.
2.  Build your ROS 2 workspace.
3.  Source the `install/setup.bash` file.
4.  Launch your ROS 2 node.

</div>

<div className="personalized-block content-for-jetson-orin-nano" style={{display: 'none'}}>

**Edge Deployment (Jetson Orin Nano):**
1.  Ensure the Jetson is powered on and connected via SSH.
2.  Use `scp` or `rsync` to transfer your built ROS 2 package to the Jetson.
3.  On the Jetson, source the workspace: `source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash`.
4.  Run your launch file: `ros2 launch my_package my_launch_file.py`.

</div>

<div className="personalized-block content-for-cloud-native-lab" style={{display: 'block'}}>

**Cloud Deployment (AWS g5.2xlarge):**
1.  From your AWS dashboard, launch a `g5.2xlarge` instance using the "NVIDIA Deep Learning AMI".
2.  Ensure your security group has inbound rules to allow SSH access.
3.  Connect to the instance and clone your project repository from GitHub.
4.  Build your workspace and launch the node.

</div>


## Translation and Accessibility

To make this content accessible to a broader audience, we have integrated a language-switching feature. At the start of each chapter, you will find a language toggle: **English | اردو**.

This feature is powered by Docusaurus's built-in **internationalization (i18n)** system. When you click on "اردو," the website will seamlessly navigate you to the Urdu version of that page. This is possible because the textbook maintains a parallel directory of translated markdown files. These translations are provided by dedicated community contributors to ensure accuracy and readability.
